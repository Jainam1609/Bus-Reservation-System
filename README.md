# Problem Statement:
Booking a bus can be a time-consuming and stressful task, requiring users to navigate multiple websites and offline booking counters to find the best deal. This process can be especially challenging for individuals who are not familiar with the travel industry or are not tech-savvy. Additionally, users may have to deal with unreliable payment systems or security issues when booking their buses online, further complicating the process.
